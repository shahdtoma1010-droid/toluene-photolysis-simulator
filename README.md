# toluene-photolysis-simulator
The developed application allows users to explore how UV radiation propagates through the medium and how the photolysis rate of toluene evolves spatially and temporally. By adjusting physical parameters such as UV intensity and absorption, the simulator provides intuitive insight into the governing photochemical processes.
